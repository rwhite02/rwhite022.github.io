Texas Hold 'Em has become the most popular version of poker in the United States, and I'd like to explore
its origins, as well as how the game has evolved in the ways in which it's played and portrayed. Texas Hold 'Em started out as a relatively small game in the early 1900s, and more recently in the 2000s the game of Texas Hold 'Em gained more popularity due to its TV coverage and main event in the World Series of Poker. I'll explore the different events that led to its explosion in popularity and different methods in which the game is played today.

## Unknown Origins
The game of Texas Hold 'Em Poker is true to its name, as it was created some time in the early 20th century
in the State of Texas, however, it's unknown exactly when and where the game was created. It's **mostly** agreed
upon that the game was birthed in the town of Robstown ([Black Hawk Casinos and Resorts, 2023](https://visitblackhawk.org/blog/history-of-texas-hold-em/)). There are some objections that the game was formed in the town of Robstown, and that the time period was the early 20th century.

Anthony Holden, an English writer, has been quoted as saying "There's no evidence beyond this eyebrow-raising 
document that Texas Hold'em dates back to the early 1900s," Holden confirms, "and nothing but 'tradition' to suggest the first hand was dealt in... Robstown," a city Holden relevantly points out wasn't even founded until 1906 ([Harris, 2022](https://www.pokernews.com/news/2017/04/poker-pop-culture-047-mystery-texas-holdem-history-27558.htm)).


## Adopted by Las Vegas
Whether or not the game was invented in the early 20th century in Robstown, Texas, this wouldn't have changed
it's blow up once it was brought outside the state of Texas. For years in 1967, the only casino on the Las Vegas
strip that offered Texas Hold 'Em games was the Golden Nugget. This was until The Dunes Casino, which was right on
the Las Vegas strip hosted a large game in the entrance of the casino ([White Knuckle Cards, 2023](http://whiteknucklecards.com/articles/history_texas_holdem.html)). This left players wanting more, which directed them to the
Golden Nugget Casino, which at the time remained the only place you could sit in at a hand of Texas Hold 'Em.

Its massive exposure in Las Vegas was just in time for the birth of the World Series of Poker, a
tournament-style series of poker games which ends with a single winner annually. After it gained tons of traction in Vegas, the inaugural World Series of Poker held a game of Texas Hold 'Em and it's been a featured game for the World Series of Poker ever since ([Rafferty, 2023](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Texas-holdem)).
