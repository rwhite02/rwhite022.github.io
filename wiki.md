Texas Hold 'Em has become the most popular version of poker in the United States, and I'd like to explore
its origins, as well as how the game has evolved in the ways in which it's played and portrayed. Texas Hold 'Em started out as a relatively small game in the early 1900s, and more recently in the 2000s the game of Texas Hold 'Em gained more popularity due to its TV coverage and main event in the World Series of Poker. I'll explore the different events that led to its explosion in popularity and different methods in which the game is played today.
